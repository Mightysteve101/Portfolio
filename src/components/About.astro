                Hey there! Iâ€™m Isaac Evans, a web developer from the city of Las Cruces, New Mexico. Graduating from Eastern New Mexico University with a degree in Computer Science, I found my passion for creating aesthetic looking websites. I worked with Eastern New Mexico University to maintain and update their school website which showed a little at what is was like to be a developer. In my free time I enjoy playing guitar, video games and Jiu-Jitsu.
